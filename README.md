# The Very Stable Genius Thoughts Protector. YOUR THOUGHTS - LOCK THEM UP.

When Geniusery strikes, make sure to drop Twitter and hold onto those precious insights forever - with teh Stabel Genius!


This Clone was made as a Ruby on Rails Tutorial and styled using custom styling. There is special emphasis on Users with Devise gem, HAML and CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) ability. It was made with the idea that notes created should only be viewable to the creator. With the exception of the landing page, there are no public or social features.
